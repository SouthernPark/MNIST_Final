MIT Remote Course
Last winter holiday, I joined a MIT Big Data Remote Course to do some research. The final purpose of this course is to build up a website which can let user upload a handwriting picture of number (what I said is something about MNIST). After uploading the picture, the website can return what the number is and store the result in Cassandra which is a database. Many steps are needed to finish this work.

Firstly, I use Python and Flask to build up a website. This website has a connection with my computer through 7000 port. Therefore, users can post a picture to the website and my computer can get this picture. 

Secondly, to recognize a handwriting picture, I have to learn TensorFlow. To be honest, I don’t have the ability to write the entire code, but I know I can learn from others. I find someone’s MNIST code from GitHub and change something to meet my requirements. However, I still know a few things about how it works. The pictures are in the format of 28*28 pixels. So we can produce a 28*28 matrix whose elements are a float between 0 and each element represents the darkness of that pixel. By using the MNIST train sets, I can train my model and produce a model with approximately 100% accuracy. After that, I can use the model to recognize the picture. 

Finally, the teacher asked me to encapsulate those codes using Docker. Docker can be thought as a small scale virtual machine, which is very useful for dealing specific purpose problem. I put the website and data base into Docker and Docker is connected with the website through 7000 port. My computer is connected with docker through 80 port. By doing this, my python code can run in the Docker rather than in my Ubuntu Operating System. What is more, the images (a terminology) produced by Docker can running on every Operating system which is very convenient..
